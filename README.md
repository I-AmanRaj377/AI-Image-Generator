# AI-Image-Generator

Utilizes the OpenAI API and the DALL-E model to generate original images based on user-provided text descriptions. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and is able to generate a wide range of images, from photorealistic to highly stylized. The project also has a front-end interface built using React, allowing users to easily generate their own images.
